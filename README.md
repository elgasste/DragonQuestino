# DragonQuestino

This is a remake of the original [Dragon Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_(video_game)) for the NES ("Dragon Warrior" in the US), built specifically for the Arduino Giga R1 board. It started as a challenge to build a video game for the Arduino Mega 2560 R3, but I wasn't able to finish it, so here we are.

## Hardware

This project is designed to use the following hardware:

- [Arduino Giga R1 Wifi board](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/giga-r1-wifi)
- [Arduino Giga R1 Display Shield](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/giga-display-shield)
- Nintendo Entertainment System controller (any knockoff will do)

## Wiring

The wiring is quite simple. The display shield is designed to attach directly to the back of the circuit board, and the controller only has five wires that need to be connected. The following photos match with the corresponding colos in the diagram:

# DragonQuestino

Dragon Quest, on an Arduino!

## Hardware

This project is designed to use the following hardware:

- [Arduino Giga R1 Wifi board](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/giga-r1-wifi)
- [Arduino Giga R1 Display Shield](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/giga-display-shield)
- Nintendo Entertainment System controller (any knockoff will do)

## Wiring

The wiring is quite simple. The display shield is designed to attach directly to the back of the circuit board, and the controller only has five wires that need to be connected. The following photos match with the corresponding colos in the diagram:
